## Analysis

D Measure spring constant
D Calculate theoretical normal mode frequencies
D Verification of single car frequency
D Find these normal modes and measure amplitudes and phase of each car
D Make a sinusoidal fit to the amplitude of displacement as a function of distance along the air track
D Use this to determine the experimental wavelength of oscillation (i.e. period sort of)
* Measure damping forces and explain how these affect w *** Not done
* Determine what happens if driving freq goes above highest normal mode

- Present data in
    - A table containing
        D n
        D Angular frequencies
        D Propagation constants
        D Wavelength
        * Phase velocity
        * Group velocity
    D Relevant graphs


MISC TODO:
- Get length of track / distance between cars
